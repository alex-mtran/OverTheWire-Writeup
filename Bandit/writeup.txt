Notes:

Steps:
	ssh -p 2220 bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org





lvl 0 -> 1: [password01]
Notes:
Use ls to list content; cat to output content to terminal

Steps:
	ls
	cat readme





lvl 1 -> 2: [password12]

	cat inhere/...H (tab complete this)





lvl 4 -> 5: [password45]
Notes:
find . -exec COMMAND {} + is for batch execution (find . -exec COMMAND ; for single runs per file)
COMMAND is the command to be done to the files specified after find and before -exec
Use batch execution version in order to combine with operators (pipe, redirect, etc)

Steps:
	ls
	cd inhere/
	find -exec file {} + | grep ASCII
	cat ./-file07





lvl 5 -> 6: [password56]
Notes:
find -size in bytes uses 'c' after the number
! -executable excludes executable files
-exec file {} + | grep ASCII runs file command and pipes output with grep ASCII

Steps:
	cd inhere/
	find . -size 1033c ! -executable -exec file {} + | grep ASCII
	cat ./maybehere07/.file2





lvl 6 -> 7: [password67]
Notes:
find / searches entire server instead of from root directory ~
2>/dev/null redirects stderrs (2) to /dev/null
-exec cat {} \; outputs the content of the file found
| xargs cat can be used as an alternative

Steps:
	find / -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null -exec cat {} \;





lvl 7 -> 8: [password78]
Notes:
Use "" around the string phrase to search for if string has spaces

Steps:
	ls
	grep millionth data.txt





lvl 8 -> 9: [password89]
Notes:
uniq -u outputs lines that do not have duplicates

Steps:
	sort data.txt | uniq -u





lvl 9 -> 10: [password910]
Notes:
xxd -l n outputs only the first n bytes

Steps:
	xxd -l 64 data.txt | grep ==





lvl 10 -> 11: [password1011]
Notes:
base64 -d decodes instead of encodes

Steps:
	base64 -d data.txt





lvl 11 -> 12: [password1112]
Notes:
tr translates characters in the first group to the second
ROT13 shifts letters by 13 positions
	
Steps:
	cat data.txt | tr [A-Za-z] [N-ZA-Mn-za-m]





lvl 12 -> 13: [password1213]
Notes:
each compression type has magic bytes (hexadecimal)
Gzip			1f 8b 08
Bzip2			42 5a 68
Tar				7573 7461 7220 (ustar offset 257)
file and xxd can be used to identify file types

Steps:
	mktemp -d
	cd (temp directory)
	cp ~/data.txt .
	xxd -r data.txt > binary
	file binary
	mv binary binary.gz
	gunzip binary.gz
	file binary
	mv binary binary.bz2
	bunzip2 binary.bz2
	file binary
	mv binary binary.gz
	gunzip binary.gz
	file binary
	mv binary binary.tar
	tar -xf binary.tar
	file data5.bin
	mv data5.bin data5.tar
	tar -xf data5.tar
	file data6.bin
	mv data6.bin data6.bz2
	file data6
	mv data6 data6.tar
	tar -xf data6.tar
	file data8.bin
	mv data8.bin data8.gz
	gunzip data8.gz
	file data8





lvl 13 -> 14: ssh -p 2220 -i privatekeyfilelocal bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
Notes:
ssh -i specifies the identity file for public key authentication

Steps:
	exit
	scp -P 2220 bandit13@bandit.labs.overthewire.org:privatekeyfile privatekeyfilelocal
	ssh -p 2220 -i privatekeyfilelocal bandit14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org





lvl 14 -> 15: [password1415]
Notes:

Steps:
	cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 [outputs password14]
	nc localhost 30000

lvl 15 -> 16: [password1516]
Notes:
openssl s_client acts as a simple SSL/TLS client

Steps:
	openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001
	[submit password1415]





lvl 16 -> 17: ssh -p 2220 -i privatekeyfile bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org
Notes:
look for ports with ssl/unknown return responses
-sV detects service versions
--script ssl-cert retrieves TLS certificate details
password must be piped via printf | openssl

Steps:
	cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit16
	nmap -p 31000-32000 -sV -v --script ssl-cert localhost
	printf "[password1516]\n" | openssl s_client -connect localhost:[specific port with ssl/unknown return response] -quiet
